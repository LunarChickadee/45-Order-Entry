Bugs:

When doing entry post collating, and the Customer is found and already has an number, Pan wills try to call the field 
but not be able to. Need to find the spot where it is. 


Edits: 

In Next/1:

added a formcheck to make sure the user is in the right form
added a WinCheck variable to see what windows are open to help with referencing correct windows 

        ___ PROCEDURE next/1 ___________________________________________________________
        global WinCheck, intOrder1

        intOrder1=int(OrderNo)

        WinCheck=info("windows")

        case intOrder1 ≥ 700000
            if WinCheck notcontains "seedsinput"
            openform "seedsinput"
            endif
        case intOrder1 ≥ 600000 and intOrder1 < 700000
            if WinCheck notcontains "mtinput"
            openform "mtinput"
            endif
        case intOrder1 ≥ 500000 and intOrder1 < 600000
            if WinCheck notcontains "bulbsinput"
            openform "bulbsinput"
            endif
        case intOrder1 ≥ 400000 and intOrder1 < 500000
            if WinCheck notcontains "treesinput"
            openform "treesinput"
            endif
        case intOrder1 ≥ 300000 and intOrder1 <400000
            if WinCheck notcontains "ogsinput"
            openform "ogsinput"
            endif
        endcase


//!!!!!! This is missing an argument. Why is it here?
drawobjects



In .customerfill

Previous work that isn't finished
//******!!needs testing
//SpareText3=datepattern(today(),"MM/DD/YY")+" - Most Recent Order"+" "+"S"+str(S)+" "+"T"+str(T)+" "+"B"+str(Bf)
//currently is holding "Previous Addresses" from an incomplete macro
//perhaps make a dicitonary of both of these data points? 



Updated the UPdatemaail and newsearch macros to make them actually loop correctly

to do on 8/2/22:

Find out what is saving on a server???
-hit saveall to make it happen


makesure the addmail part works correctly 

    if info("dialogtrigger") contains "ok"
                find exportline() contains chosenAddress
                if info("found")=-1
                    message "Found!"
                    call "enter/e"
                else
                    message "error, repeating search..."
                    farcall "45orders","NewSearch/`"
                endif
            endif
            if info("dialogtrigger") contains "search"
                farcall "45orders","NewSearch/`"
            endif
            if info("dialogtrigger") contains "cancel"
            stop
            endif
             goto addmail
        endif
    endif
endif


use magicwindow to set the dimentions for the order entry windows see "Magicwindow" in the reference


Theres a lot of things that do a find and then if it doesnt find someone, it just adds a record
+++you need more than just that loop on those
